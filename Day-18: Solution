Find H-Index

Solution:
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        n = len(citations)
        # buckets[h] counts how many papers have exactly h citations,
        # with bucket n collecting all papers having >= n citations.
        buckets = [0] * (n + 1)
        for c in citations:
            if c >= n:
                buckets[n] += 1
            else:
                buckets[c] += 1

        # Walk from high to low: cumulative = papers with >= h citations
        cumulative = 0
        for h in range(n, -1, -1):
            cumulative += buckets[h]
            if cumulative >= h:
                return h
        return 0
