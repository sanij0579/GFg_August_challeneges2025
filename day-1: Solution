Balancing Consonants and Vowels Ratio
Solution:
class Solution:
    def countBalanced(self, arr):
        vowels = set('aeiou')
        diff_count = {0: 1}  # diff -> frequency
        diff = 0
        res = 0

        for s in arr:
            for ch in s:
                if ch in vowels:
                    diff += 1
                else:
                    diff -= 1
            # Count balanced segments ending here
            res += diff_count.get(diff, 0)
            diff_count[diff] = diff_count.get(diff, 0) + 1

        return res
