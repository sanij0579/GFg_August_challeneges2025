Check if a String is Subsequence of Other
Solution:
class Solution:
    def isSubSeq(self, s1, s2):
        i, j = 0, 0
        n, m = len(s1), len(s2)
        
        # Traverse both strings
        while i < n and j < m:
            # If current chars match, move i
            if s1[i] == s2[j]:
                i += 1
            # Always move j
            j += 1
        
        # If all chars of s1 are found in s2 in order
        return i == n
